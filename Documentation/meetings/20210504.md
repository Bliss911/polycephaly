#Open Mainframe Project - Polycephaly
TSC Meeting
May 3, 2021

Agenda:
- Request to convert Polycephaly from Jenkins to Gitlab-CI
  - Polycephaly and Sample Application have been successfully built using the internal Gitlab-CI runners
  - The Gitlab-CI runners, were setup on UB42JEN2, with SSH into the z/OS using my UserID
  - Still have some clean up work to do
- Issues outstanding with Gitlab-CI
  - Merge the two sets of Polycephaly code back into the Master branch on OMP's Github
  
- Issues outstanding with Jenkins
	- Currently Polycephaly is only setup to do a Jenkins full build, and not an User build coming from an IDE. 
			If possible, make the User Build available via IDE
	- JCL method in DBB is missing
	- New feature, provide way to delete z/OS dev datasets
	- Jenkins trigger build from Github
   	- Single source program build isn't working, for the build list selection
  	- Documentation needs to be updated to reflect changes to source code
  	- Helpful guide needs to be written about the various parms and when to use them
  - After the source code, need to do full test build and deploy on Jenkins, using the Master branch


- New items to discuss
	- Status of Polycephaly using Gitlab-CI
	- Question of how to keep OMP's Github and internal or customer's Gitlab-CI instanaces in sync
	
- Items tabled:
	- COBOL v6 installation 
	- "Service Account" for Jenkins z/OS slave
	
- To Do items:
	- Setup the JCL run groovy to submit JCL from z/OS PDS or OMVS directory 
	- Verify all the DBB server functions are working properly
	- Add more test cases to Polycephaly build
	- Need to build video demo of Polycephaly
