Meeting notes:
- Issue with sFTP not started, preventing Jenkins' z/OS slave from starting. Alex was able to restart it, but not sure why it is stopping
- COBOL v6 has been ordered and will be installed, when the order arrives. This will not impact the development of the Polycephaly project
- We have started to use the Issues, to track problems, issues and enhancements to Polycephaly
- Most of the outstanding, undocumented issues, have been resolved
- Passing the return code to the Jenkins pipeline, in the event of build failure, has been resolved
- An Assembler test case has been added to the Polycepahly test cases and has been successfully tested, during the Polycephaly pipeline
